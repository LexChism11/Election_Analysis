# Overview of Election Audit:
## In this project, we have been commissioned to analyze election audit results for our friends Seth and Tom. Using the software applications Python, Visual Basic code, we looped through numerous amounts of votes and were able to calculate percent of votes per county. We analyzed data from 3 different counties and analyzed their voter turnout and calculated an overall winner through code.
# Election-Audit Results:
•	The number of votes casted in this congressional election was 369,711 votes

•	

•	 

•	Casper earned 85,213 votes making him 23.0% of the county votes, DeGette was 73.8% of the votes with 272,892 votes, and Doane was 3.1% of the county votes with 11,606 votes

•	DeGette was the victor in this election with 272,892 votes and a winning percentage of 73.8%
# Election-Audit Summary:
### I propose using this script for any type of voter or competition analysis. This script made it simpler to compile information from multiple different variables and analyze similarities within those variables. Businesses will be able to take advantage of this by asking their consumers to evaluate their business. Business can serve their clients from any region, assess their opinions on multiple products/services and update their marketing campaigns by refactoring the code to count the sales in different states. A company would be able to look at where they should open their newest location. Another option would be to change the code to count statistics for all NFL teams giving you the option to calculate a winner based on multiple different statistics for 40 different teams.
